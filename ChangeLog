2013-07-28  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* configure.ac: Move to version 2.9.1.  There was an issue with
	the configure setup.  So autoreconf and redistribute.

2013-07-26  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* dataxfer.c: Fix a bug in format strings where hex element (\x)
	would have the wrong values for a-f.  Pointed out by Galen Seitz.

2013-07-26  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* configure.ac: Version 2.9.

2013-07-25  Yegor Yefremov <yegorslists@googlemail.com>

	* Make RFC2217 signature configurable:
	Add '-s' option to configure default signature, that can be
	requested via RFC2217 protocol (option 0).
	Add per port signature via SIGNATURE keyword.

2013-06-29  Yegor Yefremov <yegorslists@googlemail.com>

	* dataxfer.c: The baudrate, that will be sent to the client,
	was converted twice: first with htonl() and then via copying
	to the buffer. As result 38400 was transfered as 6500960000
	instead of 6500009600.

2013-05-07  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* buffer.c: Add a buffer wrap that was missed, identified by
	Brian Rzycki.

2013-03-01  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* Makefile.am: Added 'ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I m4' as suggested by
	libtoolize.

	* configure.in -> configure.ac

	* configure.ac: Add 'AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR([m4])' as suggested by
	libtoolize.

	* configure.ac: Version 2.8.

2013-02-28  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* dataxfer.c, readconfig.c: Properly handle an empty string passed
	as a banner, openstr, or closestr.

2013-01-29  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* utils.h, utils.c: Have scan_tcp_port() take the domain.

	* dataxfer.c, controller.c: If the socket open fails with
	EAFNOSUPPORT, retry the address with IF_INET (IPV4-only).  This
	way the call will still work even if IPV6 is disabled.

2012-12-19  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* README: Add info on how to generate configure and friends.

2012-12-13  Jordi Riera-Babures <jrierab@gmail.com>, Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>
	* devcfg.c: Add support for a bunch of high-speed baud rates.

2012-12-07  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* utils.c: Change hints.ai_family from AF_INET6 to AF_UNSPEC.
	That way it won't force IPV6, but it will return either.  I
	think that's right.

2012-12-04  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* utils.c, utils.h:  Modify scan_tcp_port to return the length of
	the socket info returned by getaddrinfo().

	* controller.c, dataxfer.c: Use the length returned by
	scan_tcp_port(), not the size of sockaddr_storage, for the length
	of the socket information.

2012-09-26  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* configure.in: Move to 2.8-rc3

	* dataxfer.c, dataxfer.h, selector.c, selector.h, ser2net.c: Add
	clean shutdown handling so locks are properly removed when the
	program is killed with SIGINT.

	* dataxfer.c: Modify the lock files to be Linux FHS compiliant.

2012-09-10  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* dataxfer.c: Fix a bug reported by Jan-Benedict Glaw, where
	port->dinfo.openstr may be NULL, but srdup is called on it
	without checking.  Add a check.

2012-07-23  qchats lee <qchats@gmail.com>

	* dataxfer.c: My change for this did not match Qchats' change,
	so fix that.

	* utils.c: Fix the write_full() function to handle the return
	result properly; the parenthesis in the if statement ended
	in the wrong place.

2012-07-22  qchats lee <qchats@gmail.com>

	* dataxfer.c: Add a missing ")" after the "OPEN(..." when
	header tracing.

2012-04-18  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* buffer.c, buffer.h, Makefile.am: Added a new type and set of
	operations for buffer handling.  This simplifies and allows
	abstraction of other parts of the code.

	* dataxfer.c, telnet.c, telnet.h, controller.c: Switch
	out_telnet_cmd and associated parts to be the new buffer type.

	* dataxfer.c: Switch the banner over to the new buffer type.

	* dataxfer.c: Consolidate banner and filename string handling.
	Note that there was an issue with \s, as it was something
	different in banners and filenames.  Added new options, \S (for
	seconds) and \B (for serial port parameters) to resolve this
	issue, and \s is backwards compatible but deprecated.

	* ser2net.8, ser2net.conf: Since the consolidated banner/filename
	processing allows all the \<x> options to be available for both
	banners and filenames, rework the documentation.

	* dataxfer.c: Convert the main I/O buffers for data transfer to
	the new buffer type.

	* devcfg.h, devcfg.c, readconfig.c, utils.h: Added a
	new OPENSTR and CLOSESTR option for the configuration file.  These
	are strings that will be transmitted to the device when a port is
	opened and/or closed.

	* ser2net.8, ser2net.conf: Added docs for the OPENSTR and CLOSESTR
	options.

	* dataxfer.c: Handle the new OPENSTR and CLOSESTR options.  This
	required adding a new state, PORT_CLOSING, for the tcp_to_dev_state
	to say that the port is closing but data is going out, and splitting
	up the shutdown handling.

	* utils.c: Fixed a bug that cause the "port in use" error on the
	TCP connection to be printed strangely.

	* dataxfer.c: Since the banner handling no longer depends on being
	able to put the whole banner in the output buffer, reduce the port
	buffer sizes to 64 bytes to reduce memory usage

	* selector.c: maxfd was not initialized for a selector, fix that.

	* configure.in: Move to 2.8-rc2.

2012-04-04  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* dataxfer.c: Turn on the tcp write handler at first for raw
	sockets, otherwise the banner won't come out till some data
	comes in on the port.

2012-04-03  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* devcfg.c: Add 600 baud.

2012-03-27  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* ser2net.c, readconfig.c, ser2net.h, controller.c, ser2net.conf:
	Add a method to specify the control port in the ser2net config
	file.

	* dataxfer.c, controller.c: Add SO_KEEPALIVE to socket connections
	so the connection will drop if the other end just goes away.

	* configure.in: Move to 2.8-rc1.

2011-08-12  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* dataxfer.c: Fix some unaligned write issues in telnet options.

	* dataxfer.c: Fix some signed/unsigned comparison issues and
	a typo.

2011-06-22  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* utils.h, utils.c, controller.c, dataxfer.c: Fix some warnings
	about the write() return value not being checked.  These were
	almost all cases where a failure didn't matter (tracing), except
	for writing the pid file, where it should have been a handled
	failure.

	* dataxfer.c: Cleaned up some style issues in the UUCP locking code.

	* ser2net.c: Fixed a warning about not checking the chdir() return
	code, and added some improved logging information to syslog.

2010-03-11  Mats Erik Andersson <mats.andersson@mea.homelinux.org>,
	Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* controller.c, dataxfer.c, utils.c, utils.h: Add IPV6 address
	compatability.

2009-11-12  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* ser2net.spec, ser2net.spec.in: Fix the version in the spec
	file to be updated automatically.

2009-11-12  Philip Gwyn

	* dataxfer.c, devcfg.c, devcfg.h, ser2net.8: Add the ability to
	dump trace files in a binary format with timestamps.

2009-11-03  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* configure.in: Move version to 2.7 for release.

2009-10-23  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* configure.in: Move to 2.7-rc3.

	* dataxfer.c, devcfg.c, devcfg.h, ser2net.h: Modified the tb=
	directive to work separately from tw= and tr=, so you can do all
	three at the same time independently.

	* readconfig.c: Improved an error report.
	
2009-10-22  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* ser2net.c: Set up routing errors to stderr before reading the
	config so config errors come out properly to stdout.

	* ser2net.8, ser2net.conf: Fix the documentation, it's tw=, not
	tw: for the tracefile stuff.

	* configure.in: Move to 2.7-rc2.

2009-10-15  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* dataxfer.c, devcfg.c, readconfig.c, ser2net.8, ser2net.conf: Add
	the ability to trace data read written to trace files.

2009-07-19  Geoff Simmons <gsimmons@gsimmons.org>

	* ser2net.conf: Some documentation cleanup, added missing docs
	for the timeout parameter.

	* README - Minor doc cleanup.
	
2009-07-15  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* configure.in: Move to version 2.6.
	
2009-06-30  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* dataxfer.c, devcfg.c, devcfg.h, readconfig.h, utils.h: Add the
	a TRACEFILE option to trace all I/O to a file., and separate
	out the defconfig into a separate structure to avoid passing a
	boatload of things to the config.
	
2009-06-30  Sebastian Andrzej Siewior <bigeasy@linutronix.de>

	* controller.c: Fix use after free in controller

          The controller will use its dynamically allocated data after it
	  got free() in error path. What we see in syslog is:

          Jun 30 10:26:38 consrv3 ser2net[3073]: read error for
		controller port: Connection reset by peer
          Jun 30 10:26:39 consrv3 ser2net[3073]: The tcp write for
		controller had error: Bad file descriptor

          The first error is "legal" because the destitnation decided to
	  close its socket a little to early than expected. The second
	  error is allready bad because it tries to use allready
	  deallocated fd. Later we segfault.

2007-11-16  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* configure.in: Move to version 2.5.

2007-11-16  Harry Flick, Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* devcfg.c, devcfg.h, dataxfer.c, ser2net.conf, ser2net.8: Allow a
	"NOBREAK" option to disable automatically messing with the break
	operations on the serial port.  Useful for systems with a broken
	break.

2007-11-16  Robert Edmonds <edmonds@debian.org>,Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>
	
	* ser2net.c, ser2net.8: Add a '-P' option to specific that a
	pidfile be created.

2007-05-03  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* dataxfer.c: Change the rfc2217 signature response code
	from 0 to 100.  Best guess on what this should be, as the
	RFC doesn't give the correct value and says "text".

2007-04-26  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* dataxfer.c: Disable the Nagle algorithm (enable TCP_NODELAY) on
	the TCP ports to avoid long delays on short pieces of data.

	* configure.in: Move to version 2.4.

2007-03-19  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* dataxfer.c: Use the proper value for modem data notifies sent
	to the client, it was 7, use 107 instead.

2006-12-01  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* readconfig.c: Handle an ending banner that does not have a '\n'
	in the last line.

	'\s' banner token for printing out the serial parameters.

	* ser2net.conf: Cleaned up the ugly banner3.

	* Makefile.am: Add ser2net.init to EXTRA_DIST.

	* configure.in: Move to version 2.3.

2005-12-29  Aurelien Jarno <aurel32@debian.org>	
	
	* devcfg.c: Don't include "termio.h", but do include
	"sys/ioctl.h".

2005-10-20  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* dataxfer.c: Fixed a problem with rfc2217 stop bit size setting.
	It was interpreting the value of "3" as 2 stop bits, but 3 is for
	1.5 stop bits, and 2 is for 2 stop bits.

	* controller.c: Fixed some warnings dealing with char/unsigned
	char problems.
	* dataxfer.c: ditto
	* telnet.c: ditto

2005-08-25  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* dataxfer.c: Fix a problem wih EAGAIN just returning and not

2003-12-20  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* dataxfer.c, ser2net.8: Added the ability to have port 0 mean use
	standard in/out.  This way, you can invoke ser2net from inetd.

	* devcfg.c: Allow "," to be used as an option separator.

	* readconfig.c: Fix handling of lines coming from "-C".

	* ser2net.c: Move creation of the selector to before the option
	processing, for support of "-C'.

	port, duplicating them so they will come through right.

	* telnet.c: Reset the telnet protocol state after two IACs are
	received.

	* readconfig.c, readconfig.h, ser2net.c, ser2net.8: Added a way to
	specify individual config lines on the command line so that no
	config file is necessary.

	* configure.in: Moved to version 2.1.

	* dataxfer.c: Have the telnet option responses use the 1xx
	responses to the com port control options.  I believe this is
	wrong, but it is consistent with other products already in the
	field.

	* dataxfer.c, ser2net.c, telnet.h: Added support for setting the
	use of Cisco IOS baud rates instead of RFC 2217 ones, by command
	option.

	* configure.in, ser2net.spec: Move to version 1.8.

	* dataxfer.c: Do a tcflush(fd, TCOFLUSH) before closing the
	serial device, this avoids blocking on close.

2002-11-29  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* selector.c: More timer heap bugs.

2002-10-01  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* devcfg.h, devcfg.c, controller.c, dataxfer.c, dataxfer.h, ser2net.8:
	Ben Adams sent a patch to control the DTR and RTS lines, I rewrote
	it to make a new command to do this (instead of using devconfig,
	which didn't really match the devconfig's operation).

	* configure.in, ser2net.spec: Updated to version 1.5

2001-07-26  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* devcfg.c - Added CREAD to the cflags so the serial port will
	work, patch from Andreas Pfaller.

2001-07-03  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>
	
	* Makefile.am, ser2net.1, ser2net.8, ser2net.spec - Moved ser2net
	to /usr/sbin, renamed the makefile to have a .8 extension and
	put it in /usr/share/man.

	* controller.c - Fixed problems with telnet handling in the
	control interface.
	
	* Updated to version 1.4
	
2001-06-29  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	to AC_CHECK_LIB.

	* all - changed to version 1.3.

2001-06-28  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* dataxfer.c - Added the ability to convert a telnet break
	to a serial port break.

	* configure.in - Updated to version 1.3

	* ser2net.spec - Added this file for RPM building, from Ivan
	Francolin Martinez.

	* dataxfer.c - Added a tcp_wrappers implementation, from Ivan
	Francolin Martinez.  However, some configure work needs to
	be done to make it actually work properly.

	* dataxfer.c, controller.c, configure.in, ser2net.1 - Fixed the
	tcp_wrappers stuff to work properly, did the config stuff for it,
	and added it to the control port as well.

2001-06-15  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>
	
	* controller.c - Made sure the monitor port was set to null
	when the port exited.

	* ser2net.c, controller.c - added a way to query the version from
	the command line and from the controller port.

	* controller.c, controller.h, dataxfer.c, dataxfer.h - added
	monitoring of data flowing into a port.  It's somewhat primitive
	yet, but still useful

	a port from the control port.

2001-06-04  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* Initial creation.
