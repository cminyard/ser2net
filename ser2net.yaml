# # to when a connection comes in, in this case serial device /dev/ttyS0
# # with the given serial parameters.  local means to ignore modem

# # Now lets talk about secure connections.  At this stage in the state
# # of computers, all your connections should be at least encrypted, and
# # preferably authenticated.
# #
# # Note that the examples below use SCTP.  TCP can be subtituted.  They
# # also use the echo gensio, which is useful for testing.
# #
# # For encrypted connections to work, you need to use the ssl gensio
# # over other connections.  This requires a certificate and key, which
# # reside in /etc/ser2net/ser2net.crt and /etc/ser2net/ser2net.key by
# # default.  You can, of course, change the defaults or override these
# # on the accepter line.  Make sure ser2net.key is not readable by
# # anyone but the user running ser2net, or anyone can see your private
# # key.  Distribute ser2net.crt to the users so they can authenticate
# # the server.  You can get your certificate from a certificate
# # authority for best practice.  Or you can create it yourself.
# #
# # To create your own keys, do:
# #
# #   gtlssh-keygen --keydir /etc/ser2net --commonname "`hostname`-ser2net" serverkey ser2net
# #
# # which will install them in the right place.  Copy ser2net.crt to
# # the accessing system.  Restart ser2net.  You can then connect with:
# #
# #   gensiot telnet,ssl(CA=ser2net.crt),sctp,2004
# #
# # Note that the commonname of the key is important because it
# # make the subject name of the certificate more unique.  You can really
# # put anything you want for what you provide to keygen.  That will be the
# # subject name of the certificate.
# connection: &con3
#   accepter: telnet,ssl,sctp,2004
#   connector: echo
#   options:
#     banner: *banner1

# # Authentication with SSL is not shown, but is described in
# # ser2net.yaml(5).  It's fairly inconvenient.

# # Now do an authenticated connection with certauth.  You need a host
# # key/certificate pair as in the ssl-only example above.  Then you
# # need to create /usr/share/ser2net/auth/<user>.  You can create a
# # file named "password" in that directory and put a password there.
# # Make sure it's only readable by ser2net!  Or you can create a
# # directory named /usr/share/ser2net/auth/<user>/allowed_certs,
# # put the user's gtlssh certificate there, and run
# #  gtlssh-keygen rehash /usr/share/ser2net/auth/<user>/allowed_certs
# # Then you can do:
# #  gtlssh --telnet -p 2005 <user>@<hostname>
# # and do a normal gtlssh authentication.  See gtlssh(1) for details.

#   connector: echo
#   options:
#     banner: *banner1

# # If you just want to have encryption and no authentication but you want
# # to use gtlssh for login, you set allow-authfail
# # on certauth, which will run the protocol but ignore any failures, and
# # then you can just log in.  It's easy enough to just handle the
# # certificate,though, so that's really preferred.

# # The following shows how to quote some strings.  Notice they are all
# # in single quotes.  If you put them in double quotes, yaml will interpret
# # the '\' sequences on it's own, and thus ser2net will not be able to
# # process them.  The yaml rules are complex, and the single quotes are
# # not necessar in all the instance below, but it's good practice to use
# # them to avoid confusion.  Notice that you can do '' in a single quote
# # string to add one single quote.

# # An example showing mDNS support.  You must add "mdns: true" to enable
# # mDNS on a port to enable it.  By default it uses the name for the mDNS
# # name and "_iostream._xxx" for the type, where xxx is either tcp, udp
# # or sctp base on the gensio type.  Everything else defaults.  Don't
# # set mdns-host or mdns-domain unless you know what you are doing.
# # mdns-txt can be specified multiple times to add multiple strings.
# #
# # mdns-sysattrs on Linux adds USB attributes to the txt data from
# # sysfs.  If the serial port is a USB one, it will add the following
# # txt fields:
# #   devicetype=serialusb
# #   bInterfaceNumber=...
# #   interface=...
# #   idProduct=...
# #   idVendor=...
# #   serial=...
# #   manufacturer=...
# #   product=...
# # These fields are pulled straight from sysfs, see information on that
# # for details on what these mean.  Not all the fields may be present
# # depending on the specific USB device.  If you set this on a non-USB
# # serial port, it will just add:
# #   devicetype=serial
# # This may be extended in the future for other OSes or other device
