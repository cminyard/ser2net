#
# This is an example configuration file for ser2net.  It has the following
# format:
#  <TCP port>:<state>:<timeout>:<device>:<options>
#     TCP port
#            Name   or  number of the TCP/IP port to accept con-
#            nections from for this device.  A port number may
#            be of the form [host,]port, such as 127.0.0.1,2000
#            or localhost,2000.  If this is specified, it will
#            only bind to the IP address specified. Otherwise
#            it will bind to all the ports on the machine.
#
#     state  Either raw or rawlp or telnet or off.  off disables
#            the  port  from  accepting  connections.  It can be
#            turned on later from the control port.  raw enables
#            the port and  transfers  all data as-is between the
#            port  and  the long.  rawlp  enables  the port  and
#            transfers  all input data to device, device is open
#            without  any  termios  setting.  It  allow  to  use
#            /dev/lpX  devices  and  printers connected to them.
#            telnet enables the port and runs the telnet  proto-
#            col  on the port to set up telnet parameters.  This
#            is most useful for using telnet.
#
#     timeout
#            The time (in seconds) before the port will be  dis-
#            connected  if  there  is no activity on it.  A zero
#            value disables this function.
#
#     device The  name  of  the  device   to  connect  to.  This
#            must be in the form of /dev/<device>.
#
#     options
#            Sets  operational  parameters  for the serial port.
#	     For a serial device (not IPMI SOL):
#            Options 300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400,
#            57600, 115200 set the various baud rates.  EVEN,
#            ODD, NONE set the parity.  1STOPBIT, 2STOPBITS set
#            the number of stop bits.  5DATABITS, 6DATABITS,
#	     7DATABITS, 8DATABITS set the number of data bits.
#	     [-]XONXOFF turns on (- off) XON/XOFF support.
#	     [-]RTSCTS turns on (- off) hardware flow control,
#	     [-]LOCAL turns off (- on) monitoring of the modem lines,
#	     and [-]HANGUP_WHEN_DONE turns on (- off) lowering the
#            modem control lines when the connection is done. 
#            [-]NOBREAK disables automatic setting of the break
#            setting of the serial port.
#	     The following speed may be available if your system
#            has the values defined and your hardware supports
#            it: 230400, 460800, 500000, 576000, 921600, 1000000,
#            1152000, 1500000, 2000000, 2500000, 3000000, 3500000,
#	     4000000.
#
#	     SOL connections can take the following speeds: 9600, 19200,
#	     38400, 57600, and 115200 and [-]NOBREAK.  The following
#	     SOL-specific options exist: [-]authenticated enable
#	     (-disable) authentication on the link.  [-]encrypted enable
#	     (-disable) encryption on the link.  shared_serial_alert_fail
#	     fail the connection if the serial port is in use through
#	     hardware.  shared_serial_alert_deferred if the serial port
#	     is already in use through hardware, wait until it is released.
#	     shared_serial_alert_deferred if the serial port is already in
#	     use via hardware, take over the connection.
#	     [-]deassert_CTS_DCD_DSR_on_connect deassert (- do not deassert)
#	     the given serial signals on a SOL connection.  ack-timeout=n
#	     set the timeout for resending to n microseconds.
#	     ack-retries=n set the number of retries before failure to
#	     n times.
#	     
#            The "[-]remctl" option allow remote control (ala RFC
#            2217) of serial-port configuration.
#
#            A banner name, signature, open string and/or close
#            stringmay also be specified.
#
#            The rs485 option takes RS485 related configuration.
#
#            The tw, tr, and tb options take a tracefile name (
#            specified in TRACEFILE that will take all traced data.
#            tw is data written to the device, tr is data read from
#            the device, and tb is both.
#
#            The telnet_brk_on_sync option causes a telnet sync
#            operation to send a break.  By default data is flushed
#	     until the data mark, but no break is sent.
#
#	     ser2net automatically waits the time it takes to receive
#	     2 characters, or 1000us, whichever is larger, after receiving
#	     a character before sending data on the TCP port.  This
#	     allows successive characters to be batched into a single
#	     send.  You can disable this with disable-chardelay.  Or
#	     you can change the receive time with chardelay-scale=n, which
#	     sets the delay in tenths of a character period (eg 20 is
#	     2.0 periods, 15 is 1.5 periods, etc.)  The default is 20.
#	     chardelay-min=n sets the minimum delay in microseconds,
#	     this is 1000 by default.
#
#	     The [-]kickolduser setting causes a new connection to
#	     terminate any existing connection.
#
# or...

#  BANNER:<banner name>:banner
#    This will create a banner, if the banner name is given in the
#    options of a line, that banner will be printed.  This takes the
#    standard "C" \x characters (\r is carriage return, \n is newline,
#    etc.).  It also accepts \d, which prints the device name, \p,
#    which prints the TCP port number, and \s which prints the serial
#    parameters (eg 9600 N81), and a large number of date related
#    items.  See the man page for details..  Banners can span lines if
#    the last character on a line is '\'.  Note that you *must* use
#    \r\n to start a new line.
#
#  SIGNATURE:<signature name>:signature
#    This will create a RFC 2217 signature, that will be sent on clients
#    request.
#
#  RS485CONF:<RS485 configuration name>:<RTS delay before send>:<RTS delay after send>:<RTS_ON_SEND>:<RX_DURING_TX>
#    This will create a RS485 configuration set, i.e. RTS delays before and after send as
#    also RTS logical level and receive configuration.
#
#  TRACEFILE:<name>:filename
#    This specifies a filename to trace output into, as tw=/tmp/trace1.
#    This takes the same escape sequences as banners.
#
#  OPENSTR:<name>:str
#    This specifies a string to be transmitted to the device when the
#    port is opened.  This takes the same escape sequences as banners.
#
#  CLOSESTR:<name>:str
#    This specifies a string to be transmitted to the device when the
#    port is close.  This takes the same escape sequences as banners.
#
#  CLOSEON:<stop pattern>
#    This specifies a string that is compared to the data received
#    from the serial device in raw mode.  Whatever occurs first, match
#    or timeout, will shutdown the port. This can be useful to close
#    HTML transmissions from tiny Web Servers on a serial bus.
#    C-style \ sequences, like \004 for ^D, \xff, or even \x00 can be used.
#
#  CONTROLPORT:<port spec>
#    Allow the control port to be specified in the config file.
#
#  DEVICE:<name>:<device>
#    Allows the string for a device to be specified on a separate line.
#    Useful for big device names or device names that have a ":" in them.
#    Just use <name> where you would have put the device filename.
#
#  DEFAULT:<parm>:<default val>
#    Allows default paramters to be specified that will affect all entries
#    that follow this line.  You can set the default in multple places
#    to have different defaults in different areas of the file.  See
#    below for a list of defaults.
#
# Note that the same device can be listed multiple times under different
# ports, this allows the same serial port to have both telnet and raw
# protocols.
